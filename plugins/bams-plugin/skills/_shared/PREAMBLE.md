## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_GSTACK_BIN="${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../bin"
[ -x "$_GSTACK_BIN/gstack-config" ] || { _P=$(find ~/.claude/plugins/cache -path "*/bams-plugin/*/bin/gstack-config" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -1); _GSTACK_BIN=${_P%/gstack-config}; }
echo "GSTACK_BIN: ${_GSTACK_BIN:-NOT_FOUND}"
echo "BRANCH: $(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)"
```

Each Bash call is a fresh shell: in any later command that uses `$_GSTACK_BIN`, first set `_GSTACK_BIN=<GSTACK_BIN printed above>` in that same command.

## AskUserQuestion Format

Every AskUserQuestion call:
1. **Re-ground** — project, current branch (`BRANCH` from the preamble, not from conversation history), current task. 1-2 sentences.
2. **Plain language** — no internal jargon or raw function names; assume the user does not have the code open.
3. **Recommend** — `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [reason]`, plus `Completeness: X/10` per option (10 = all edge cases, 7 = happy path only, 3 = shortcut that defers real work). If the complete option costs only a little more, recommend it.
4. **Options** — lettered `A) ... B) ...`; when effort matters show `(human: ~X / CC: ~Y)`.
5. **One decision per question.** Several questions in a row are fine; a final Approve/Revise/Reject gate comes only after the individual decisions.

## Completion Status Protocol

Finish with one status: **DONE** (every claim backed by evidence) · **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** (list each concern) · **BLOCKED** (what blocks, what was tried) · **NEEDS_CONTEXT** (exactly what is missing).

Stop and escalate after 3 failed attempts at the same step, on security-sensitive changes you are unsure of, or when the scope exceeds what you can verify:
```
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
```
