## Step 3.5: Pre-merge readiness gate

**This is the critical safety check before an irreversible merge.** The merge cannot
be undone without a revert commit. Gather ALL evidence, build a readiness report,
and get explicit user confirmation before proceeding.

Collect evidence for each check below. Track warnings (yellow) and blockers (red).

### 3.5a: Review staleness check

```bash
"$_GSTACK_BIN"/gstack-review-read 2>/dev/null
```

Parse the output. For each review skill (plan-eng-review, plan-ceo-review,
plan-design-review, design-review-lite, codex-review):

1. Find the most recent entry within the last 7 days.
2. Extract its `commit` field.
3. Compare against current HEAD: `git rev-list --count STORED_COMMIT..HEAD`

**Staleness rules:**
- 0 commits since review → CURRENT
- 1-3 commits since review → RECENT (yellow if those commits touch code, not just docs)
- 4+ commits since review → STALE (red — review may not reflect current code)
- No review found → NOT RUN

**Critical check:** Look at what changed AFTER the last review. Run:
```bash
git log --oneline STORED_COMMIT..HEAD
```
If any commits after the review contain words like "fix", "refactor", "rewrite",
"overhaul", or touch more than 5 files — flag as **STALE (significant changes
since review)**. The review was done on different code than what's about to merge.

### 3.5b: Test results

**Free tests — run them now:**

Read CLAUDE.md to find the project's test command. If not specified, use `bun test`.
Run the test command and capture the exit code and output.

```bash
bun test 2>&1 | tail -10
```

If tests fail: **BLOCKER.** Cannot merge with failing tests.

**E2E tests — check recent results:**

```bash
ls -t ~/.gstack-dev/evals/*-e2e-*-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)*.json 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

For each eval file from today, parse pass/fail counts. Show:
- Total tests, pass count, fail count
- How long ago the run finished (from file timestamp)
- Total cost
- Names of any failing tests

If no E2E results from today: **WARNING — no E2E tests run today.**
If E2E results exist but have failures: **WARNING — N tests failed.** List them.

**LLM judge evals — check recent results:**

```bash
ls -t ~/.gstack-dev/evals/*-llm-judge-*-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)*.json 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

If found, parse and show pass/fail. If not found, note "No LLM evals run today."

### 3.5c: PR body accuracy check

Read the current PR body:
```bash
gh pr view --json body -q .body
```

Read the current diff summary:
```bash
git log --oneline $(gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName 2>/dev/null || echo main)..HEAD | head -20
```

Compare the PR body against the actual commits. Check for:
1. **Missing features** — commits that add significant functionality not mentioned in the PR
2. **Stale descriptions** — PR body mentions things that were later changed or reverted
3. **Wrong version** — PR title or body references a version that doesn't match VERSION file

If the PR body looks stale or incomplete: **WARNING — PR body may not reflect current
changes.** List what's missing or stale.

### 3.5d: Document-release check

Check if documentation was updated on this branch:

```bash
git log --oneline --all-match --grep="docs:" $(gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName 2>/dev/null || echo main)..HEAD | head -5
```

Also check if key doc files were modified:
```bash
git diff --name-only $(gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName 2>/dev/null || echo main)...HEAD -- README.md CHANGELOG.md ARCHITECTURE.md CONTRIBUTING.md CLAUDE.md VERSION
```

If CHANGELOG.md and VERSION were NOT modified on this branch and the diff includes
new features (new files, new commands, new skills): **WARNING — /document-release
likely not run. CHANGELOG and VERSION not updated despite new features.**

If only docs changed (no code): skip this check.

### 3.5e: Readiness report and confirmation

Build the full readiness report:

```

If there are BLOCKERS (failing free tests): list them and recommend B.
If there are WARNINGS but no blockers: list each warning and recommend A if
warnings are minor, or B if warnings are significant.
If everything is green: recommend A.

Use AskUserQuestion:

- **Re-ground:** "About to merge PR #NNN (title) from branch X to Y. Here's the
  readiness report." Show the report above.
- List each warning and blocker explicitly.
- **RECOMMENDATION:** Choose A if green. Choose B if there are significant warnings.
  Choose C only if the user understands the risks.
- A) Merge — readiness checks passed (Completeness: 10/10)
- B) Don't merge yet — address the warnings first (Completeness: 10/10)
- C) Merge anyway — I understand the risks (Completeness: 3/10)

If the user chooses B: **STOP.** List exactly what needs to be done:
- If reviews are stale: "Re-run /plan-eng-review (or /review) to review current code."
- If E2E not run: "Run `bun run test:e2e` to verify."
- If docs not updated: "Run /document-release to update documentation."
- If PR body stale: "Update the PR body to reflect current changes."

If the user chooses A or C: continue to Step 4.
